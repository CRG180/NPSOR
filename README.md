# NPSOR

As a student at the Naval Post Graduate School studying Operations Research, I find myself using a lot of the same code over and over again. How about make a R package to share with my friends? Why not !!

Letâ€™s see how this goes maybe this will be kind of cool !

## Install

`devtools::install_github("CRG180/NPSOR")`

## Linear Regression Error

*These also work with a fit object from tidymodels $fit*

**Root Mean Square Error** `RMSE(x)` x can be a `lm` object or a numeric vector of residuals <br>
**Mean Square Error** `MSE(x)` x can be a `lm` object or a numeric vector of residuals <br>
**Mean Absolute Error** `MAE(x)` x can be a `lm` object or a numeric vector of residuals

## Train and Test Data Split 
`split_df(df, p = .8)` `df`= a dataframe, `p`= proportion to be training data. Output is list with two data frames: `$train` and`$test`  

## Example 
`library(NPSOR)  `

`mtcars2 <-split_df(mtcars,.8)`

`train_model <- lm(mpg~., mtcars2$train)`

`test <- predict(train_model, mtcars2$test)`

`error <- (test-mtcars2$test$mpg)`

`test_model <-lm(mpg~., mtcars2$train)`

`RMSE(train_model) # Training RMSE`

`RMSE(error) #Test RMSE` `
